            question: " What are the different types of facelifts available?",
            answer: "There are several facelift techniques: traditional, mini, mid-facelift, and neck lift. Each targets specific areas of concern. Schedule a consultation to find the right option for you."
        },
        {
            question: "Am I a good candidate for a facelift?",
            answer: "Generally, good health, realistic expectations, and visible signs of aging like wrinkles or sagging jowls are good indicators. Dr. Garg can confirm in a consultation."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does a facelift last?",

        },
        {
            question: "How much does the best facelift cost?",
            answer: "Facelift costs depend on the surgeon's expertise, location, facility fees, anesthesia costs, and the surgery extent. To provide a cost estimate, a surgeon must first assess your requirements and goals."

                        <h2>Potential Risks and Complications of Facelift Surgery</h2>
                        <p>While facelift surgery is a safe and effective procedure when performed by a qualified cosmetic surgeon like Dr. Garg, it's essential to discuss potential risks and complications before making a decision. Here's an overview:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Infection: </strong> Although uncommon, infection is a risk with any surgery. Dr. Garg and his team prioritize a sterile environment and meticulous technique to minimize this risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Swelling and Bruising: </strong> Temporary swelling and bruising are expected after surgery and typically subside within a week or two.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temporary Numbness or Tingling: </strong> Nerves may be temporarily numb or tingly as they regenerate. This usually resolves over time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scarring: </strong> While Dr. Garg uses meticulous techniques and strategically places incisions to minimize scarring, there's always a slight risk. He will discuss scar management options with you.</li>
                            <li><strong>Revision Surgery: </strong> In rare cases, revision surgery might be needed to address concerns or refine results. However, Dr. Garg's careful preoperative examination and personalized treatment plans minimize this risk.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br /><strong>Patient Safety is Our Priority:</strong>
